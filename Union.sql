Question: 
Write a query that appends the two crunchbase_investments datasets above (including duplicate values). 
Filter the first dataset to only companies with names that start with the letter "T", and filter the second to 
companies with names starting with "M" (both not case-sensitive). Only include the company_permalink, company_name, 
and investor_name columns.

SELECT company_permalink,
       company_name,
       investor_name
  FROM tutorial.crunchbase_investments_part1
 WHERE company_name ILIKE 'T%'
 
 UNION ALL

SELECT company_permalink,
       company_name,
       investor_name
  FROM tutorial.crunchbase_investments_part2
 WHERE company_name ILIKE 'M%'
